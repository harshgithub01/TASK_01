			<h3>My Trip to California</h3>
			<p align="left">Imagine laying on a private beach right now in California. You are sitting in a comfortable lawn chair with a front-row seat to the Pacific Ocean. You have waiters bringing you any kind of drink or food you want, and the sun is making you golden tan. Now, imagine the thrill you get while being on a roller coaster. The sun is beating down on you while you are standing in line, but the wait for the exhilarating roller coaster is worth it. I was able to experience all this and more on my trip to Los Angeles, California. I went on this trip the week of my birthday with my parents and my two sisters. My second trip to California was an unforgettable experience that was important due to all the locations I visited, all the knowledge I now have from this trip, and all the memories I made with my family.</p>

			<h3>My Trip to The Rockies</h3>
			<p align="left">flew into calgary airport and picked up our rental car from avis,drove the route from calgary to canmore where we had booked rockie mountain chalets for the week the check in was quick and easy and the receptionist was really friendly,we went to our chalet and was pkeasantly supprised for the price we had paid it was great,loads of space and a great fully equiped kitchen,we were shattered fromthe flight so we went to safeway for shopping and settled in for the night.
day one....we started of gently with a hike up the mountain behind us,it was full of snow and absoloutly georgeous.
day two....drove to lake louise which is stunning,the lake was frozen and we walked right across it,on the way bak to the car my leg went down deep snow and i damaged my knee,i wasnt letting this spoil my trip so decided to carry on to the icefield parkway to the columbian icefields,again stunning...we decided not to go on the ice explored as the receptionist had told us in his opinion it wasnt worth it and with a sore leg i didnt really feel like it.

			<h3>My Trip to The Mid West</h3>
			<p align="left">“The museum’s focus on modern art began in the 1940s, when a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker made possible the acquisition of works by important artists of the day, including pieces by Franz Marc, Lyonel Feininger, and Edward Hopper. During the 1960s, the Walker organized increasingly ambitious exhibitions that circulated to museums in the United States and abroad. The Walker’s collections expanded to reflect crucial examples of contemporary artistic developments; concurrently, performing arts, film, and education programs grew proportionately and gained their own national prominence throughout the next three decades,” explains the museum website.</p>
