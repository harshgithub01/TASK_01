							<p align="left">Imagine laying on a private beach right now in California. You are sitting in a comfortable lawn chair with a front-row seat to the Pacific Ocean. You have waiters bringing you any kind of drink or food you want, and the sun is making you golden tan. Now, imagine the thrill you get while being on a roller coaster. The sun is beating down on you while you are standing in line, but the wait for the exhilarating roller coaster is worth it. I was able to experience all this and more on my trip to Los Angeles, California. I went on this trip the week of my birthday with my parents and my two sisters. My second trip to California was an unforgettable experience that was important due to all the locations I visited, all the knowledge I now have from this trip, and all the memories I made with my family.Imagine laying on a private beach right now in California.
